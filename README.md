 ### Hi, Iâ€™m Matheus Stringhetta
I'm a student of Information Systems at the Federal University of UberlÃ¢ndia.
Currently I work as a software systems development analyst.
My focus is to become an expert in Java, using various types of technologies such as Spring, REST, SQL, OracleDB, continuous integration (Docker/Kubernetes) and many others,  making the difference in the IT area, developing solutions and going ahead of my time.
